# Task-List

This is a simple task list that includes both frontend and backend. This is the code for the front end, which consists of HTML, CSS, as well as JS which adds functionality to the frontend design. I use JQuery as well.

The backend server incorporates several Nodejs packages, including Mongoose, Express, and body-parser. The server also incorporates my own API to allow the server to interact with my instance of MongoDB.

My to do list's back end and API code can be found here: https://github.com/boxcarcoder/Task-List-API.

# Task-List

This is a simple task list that includes both frontend and backend. The front end consists of HTML, CSS, as well as JS which adds functionality and logic to the frontend design. The JS uses JQuery.

The backend server incorporates several Nodejs packages, including Mongoose, Express, and body-parser. The server also incorporates my own API to allow the server to interact with my instance of MongoDB.
